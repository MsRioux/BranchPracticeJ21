# BranchPracticeJ21
This is a simple project used in Advanced Java in November 2021 to practice branching in Android Studio.  Most of the work is done through the branching widget.

Focus is on building a mental framework of the different places changes can be made and learning appropriate workflow for professional collaboration.
